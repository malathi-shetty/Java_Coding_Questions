 * Convert to Lowercase: This ensures that the check is case-insensitive.
 * 
 * Boolean Array: A boolean array alphabet of size 26 is used to track the
 * presence of each letter ('a' to 'z').
 * 
 * Character Processing: Each character in the string is checked. If it's a
 * letter, the corresponding index in the boolean array is marked as true.
 * 
 * Check Completeness: After processing the string, the boolean array is checked
 * to ensure that all letters are present.
 * 
 * main Method:
 * 
 * Creates an instance of PangramCheck.
 * 
 * Defines a test sentence.
 * 
 * Calls isPangram and prints the result.

 * It returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
 * 
 * String sentence: This is the input parameter, which is the string to be

 * boolean[] alphabet: An array of 26 boolean values (one for each letter of the

 * Character.isLetter(c): Checks if the character c is a letter.

 * c - 'a': Calculates the position of the letter c in the alphabet (e.g., 'a'

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Panagram_learn class step by step, focusing on its structure and
 * functionality.
 * 
 * Class Overview
 * 
 * The Panagram_learn class is designed to determine if a given sentence is a
 * pangram. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet
 * at least once.
 * 
 * 
 * Components of the Class
 * 
 * Method: isPangram(String sentence)
 * 
 * Purpose: To check if the provided string sentence contains every letter of
 * the English alphabet.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 
 * String sentence: The input string to check for pangram status.
 * 
 * 
 * Logic:
 * 
 * Convert to Lowercase: The input string is converted to lowercase using
 * sentence.toLowerCase(). This ensures that the check is case-insensitive,
 * meaning 'A' and 'a' are treated the same.
 * 
 * Boolean Array: A boolean array of size 26 (for each letter from 'a' to 'z')
 * is created. Initially, all values are set to false.
 * 
 * Character Traversal: The method then iterates through each character in the
 * string:
 * 
 * Check for Letters: It checks if each character is a letter using
 * Character.isLetter(c).
 * 
 * Mark Presence: If a character is a letter, its corresponding index in the
 * boolean array is marked as true. The index is calculated by index = c - 'a',
 * which maps 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1, and so on.
 * 
 * Check Completeness: After processing the string, the method iterates through
 * the boolean array:
 * 
 * If any index is false, it means that at least one letter is missing from the
 * input sentence, and the method returns false.
 * 
 * If all indices are true, the method returns true, indicating that the
 * sentence is a pangram.
 * 
 * 
 * Main Method
 * 
 * Creating an Instance: The main method creates an instance of the
 * Panagram_learn class, named checker.
 * 
 * Test Sentence: It defines a test sentence,
 * "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which is a well-known pangram.
 * 
 * Pangram Check: The method calls isPangram with the test sentence and prints
 * the result to the console. In this case, it will output true since the
 * sentence contains every letter of the alphabet.
 * 
 * 
 * Comments Section
 * 
 * The comments throughout the code are detailed and helpful, providing
 * explanations of each part of the logic:
 * 
 * Conversion to Lowercase: Emphasizes the importance of handling case
 * insensitivity.
 * 
 * Boolean Array: Explains the purpose of the boolean array and how it tracks
 * each letter's presence.
 * 
 * Character Processing: Describes how each character is checked and marked.
 * 
 * Completeness Check: Outlines how the final check is performed to confirm that
 * all letters are present.
 * 
 * Main Method: Details what the main method does, including the process of
 * creating an instance, defining a test sentence, and printing the results.
 * 
 * Summary
 * 
 * The Panagram_learn class efficiently determines if a given string is a
 * pangram by using a boolean array to track the presence of each letter of the
 * alphabet.
