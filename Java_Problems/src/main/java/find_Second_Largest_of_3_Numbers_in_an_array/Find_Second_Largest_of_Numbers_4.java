/*
 * Initialization of secondLargest: Added int secondLargest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
 * to keep track of the second largest value found during the iteration.
 * 
 * Improved Loop Condition: Changed the loop to for (int i = a.length - 2; i >=
 * 0; i--) to handle the case where we need to check for values different from
 * the largest one (a[a.length - 1]).
 * 
 * Breaking the Loop: Added break; once the second largest value is found, as
 * thereâ€™s no need to continue checking once we have our result.
 * 
 * Handling Edge Cases: Added a check to ensure that if no valid second largest
 * number is found (i.e., all numbers are the same or not enough unique
 * numbers), it prints a message saying "No second largest number found."
 * 
 * With these adjustments, your code should correctly identify the second
 * largest number in the array and handle cases where duplicates might affect
 * the result.
