/*
 * Loop Change: Replaced the for loop with a while loop. The for loop was not
 * correctly handling the case where all elements are the same or there was no
 * distinct second largest number.
 * 
 * Finding the Second Largest:
 * 
 * Start from the end of the sorted array and move backwards. Continue moving
 * backward until you find an element that is different from the largest element
 * (a[a.length - 1]). Condition Check: After the loop, if the index i is valid
 * (i.e., i >= 0), print the element at that index as the second largest.
 * Otherwise, print "No second largest number found."
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Sorting: You sort the array to simplify the process of finding the largest
 * and second largest numbers.
 * 
 * Finding the Second Largest:
 * 
 * Start at the second-to-last index of the array (i = a.length - 2). Use a
 * while loop to move backwards through the array until you find an element that
 * is not equal to the largest element (a[a.length - 1]). Output:
 * 
 * If you find a valid index (i >= 0), print the element at that index as the
 * second largest. If you donâ€™t find such an element (e.g., if all elements are
 * the same), output "No second largest number found."
 * 
 * This approach ensures that you correctly identify the second largest number
 * even if there are duplicates or all elements are the same.
