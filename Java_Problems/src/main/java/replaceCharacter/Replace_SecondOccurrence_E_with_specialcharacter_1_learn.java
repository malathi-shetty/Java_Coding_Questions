/*
 * Book: You have the string "BOOKEEPER".
 * 
 * Two: You want to replace the second occurrence of 'E'.
 * 
 * Pairs: Keep a count of occurrences. When count reaches 2, itâ€™s time to
 * replace with the special character.
 * 
 * Special Characters: Replace 'E' (second occurrence) with '#'.
 * 
 * So, following these steps in your code:
 * 
 * Initialize: Start with an empty StringBuilder and a counter.
 * 
 * Iterate: Loop through each character in the string.
 * 
 * Count Occurrences: Increase the count whenever the target character is
 * encountered.
 * 
 * Replace: When the count reaches 2, replace the character with the special
 * character.
 * 
 * Append: Append each character (whether replaced or not) to the StringBuilder.
