/*
 * The main method is the entry point of the program.
 * 
 * An array a is initialized with unsorted integers.
 * 
 * It prints the original array, calls the bubbleSort method to sort the array,
 * and then prints the sorted array.
 * 
 * 
 * Bubble Sort Method
 * 
 * The bubbleSort method takes an array of integers as input.
 * 
 * It determines the length of the array and initializes a boolean swapped to
 * track if any elements were swapped during each pass.
 * 
 * It uses two nested loops:
 * 
 * The outer loop runs through the array multiple times.
 * 
 * The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the
 * wrong order (i.e., if the earlier element is greater than the later one).
 * 
 * If no swaps occur in a full pass (indicating that the array is already
 * sorted), it breaks out of the loop early for efficiency.
 * 
 * 
 * Print Array Method
 * 
 * The printArray method takes an integer array and prints its elements.
 * 
 * It uses an enhanced for-loop to iterate through the array, printing each
 * element followed by a space.
 * 
 * 
 * Summary
 * 
 * The above program is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm,
 * which sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
 * 
 * It includes methods for sorting and printing the array, with built-in
 * efficiency to stop early if the array becomes sorted before all passes are
 * completed.
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * Original array:
 * 
64 34 25 90 12 22 90 11 

Sorted array:

11 12 22 25 34 64 90 90 
 * 
 *
