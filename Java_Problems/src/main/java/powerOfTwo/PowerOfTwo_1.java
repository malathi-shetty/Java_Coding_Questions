/*
 * 
 * You can iteratively divide the number by 2. If the number becomes 1, it's a
 * power of 2; otherwise, it's not. The process stops as soon as the number
 * becomes odd and greater than 1.
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Check if the number is less than or equal to 0: If the number is 0 or
 * negative, it can't be a power of 2.
 * 
 * While loop: The loop keeps dividing the number by 2 as long as it is
 * divisible by 2.
 * 
 * After the loop: If the number is reduced to 1, then it was a power of 2. If
 * it's anything else, it's not.
 * 
 * Example Runs:
 * 
 * For n = 8:
 * 
 * 8 รท 2 = 4
 * 
 * 4 รท 2 = 2
 * 
 * 2 รท 2 = 1
 * 
 * Since the number becomes 1, it's a power of 2, so the output is true.
 * 
 * For n = 3:
 * 
 * 3 is not divisible by 2, so the output is false.
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * For n = 8, the output will be true, and for n = 3, the output will be false.
