/*

 * Converting the string to lowercase:

First convert the input string s to lowerCaseString using s.toLowerCase() to make the comparison case-insensitive. This ensures that characters like 'N' and 'n' are treated the same when counting frequencies, but the case of the characters is preserved when printing the result.

Counting frequency:

A HashMap is used to count the frequency of each character in the lowerCaseString. For each character in lowerCaseString, the code updates its count in the map.

Identifying the first non-repeated character:

After counting the frequencies, the program iterates through the original string (s) (not the lowercase string) to find the first character whose count in map is 1. This preserves the case of the first non-repeated character in the original string. If the first non-repeated character is 'N' in the input string, it will print 'N', even if the comparison is case-insensitive during counting.

Edge Cases:

If all characters are repeated (e.g., "aabbcc"), the program prints "All characters are repeated.".

If the string consists of a single character (e.g., "a"), that character is printed since itâ€™s non-repeating.

Flag foundNonRepeating:

The program uses a boolean flag foundNonRepeating to check if any non-repeating character is found. If no non-repeating character is found, the message "All characters are repeated." is printed.
